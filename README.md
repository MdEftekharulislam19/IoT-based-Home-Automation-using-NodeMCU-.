# IoT-based-Home-Automation-using-NodeMCU.

The project aims at designing an advanced home automation system using NodeMCU ESP8266 module. The devices can be
switched ON/OFF and read using mobile through Wi-Fi. The hunger for automation brought many revolutions in the existing
technologies.These had greater importance than any other technologies due to its user-friendly nature.
Wi-Fi:-is wireless technology that uses radio frequency to transmit data through the air. Wi-Fi transmit data in the frequency
Band of 2.4 GHz. The range of Wi-Fi technology is 40-300 feet.
Controlling devices for the automation of the project is NodeMCU. The data sent from mobile over Wi-Fi will receive by Wi-Fi
module connected to NodeMCU. NodeMCU reads the data and decides the switching action of electrical devices connected to it
through Relays.

In this project, we are going to make an IOT based home automation system using NODEMCU ESP8266 Wi-Fi module and.
Using this we will be able to control home appliances through a web browser using your PC or mobile. These AC mains
appliances will be connected to relays which are controlled by the NodeMCU ESP8266 and NodeMCU acts as a Web Server and
we will send control commands through a Web Browser like Google Chrome etc. ESP8266 is the one of the most popular and
low-cost Wi-Fi module available in the market today. The goal of this project is to develop a home automation system that gives
the user complete control over all remotely controllable aspects of his/her home.
