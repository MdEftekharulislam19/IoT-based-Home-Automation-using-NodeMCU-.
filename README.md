# IoT-based-Home-Automation-using-NodeMCU.

The project aims at designing an advanced home automation system using NodeMCU ESP8266 module. The devices can be
switched ON/OFF and read using mobile through Wi-Fi. The hunger for automation brought many revolutions in the existing
technologies.These had greater importance than any other technologies due to its user-friendly nature.
Wi-Fi:-is wireless technology that uses radio frequency to transmit data through the air. Wi-Fi transmit data in the frequency
Band of 2.4 GHz. The range of Wi-Fi technology is 40-300 feet.
Controlling devices for the automation of the project is NodeMCU. The data sent from mobile over Wi-Fi will receive by Wi-Fi
module connected to NodeMCU. NodeMCU reads the data and decides the switching action of electrical devices connected to it
through Relays.
